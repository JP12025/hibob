# Hi, Bob!

# What to Do

 - Get this repository localy with `git clone`
 - Create a file `hello.py`
 - The program prompts the user for their name and then says hello to that user.
 - For instance, it musts ask `What's your name?`
 - Given the name (example `Bob`), the program should print `Hi, Bob!`

Example:
```bash
$ python hello.py
What's your name? Bob
Hi, Bob!
```

> [!TIP]
> In Python, the function `input("a text")` prints `a text` on the standard output and waits for the user to type something on the keyboard.
> For further information, [read the doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)!
